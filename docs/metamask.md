MetaMask is a popular cryptocurrency wallet and browser extension that enables users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on the EVM blockchains. It acts as a bridge between a user's web browser and an EVM blockchain, allowing them to manage their accounts, store and transfer ERC-20 tokens, and interact with smart contracts.

Here are some key features and functionalities of MetaMask:

**Wallet Management**: MetaMask allows users to create and manage multiple Ethereum accounts within their wallets. Each account has a unique address and associated private keys, which are securely stored locally on the user's device.

**Browser Extension**: MetaMask is available as a browser extension for popular web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Brave. Users can install the extension to easily access their accounts and interact with dApps directly from their browsers.

**Secure Account Access**: To ensure the security of user accounts, MetaMask requires users to enter their account password or use biometric authentication (if supported by the device) to access their accounts.

**Interaction with dApps**: MetaMask integrates with websites and dApps that are built on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to connect their accounts, sign transactions, and interact with smart contracts seamlessly.

**Token Managemen**t: MetaMask supports various ERC-20 tokens, allowing users to view and manage their token balances within the wallet. It also facilitates token transfers and token approvals required for interacting with different decentralized applications.

**Network Customization**: MetaMask allows users to switch between different EVM-based networks, including the mainnet, testnets (like Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby), and custom networks. This flexibility enables users to interact with dApps across different EVM-based networks. 

MetaMask has gained significant popularity within the blockchain ecosystem due to its user-friendly interface, seamless dApp integration, and wide adoption by developers and users alike. It serves as a crucial tool for accessing and interacting with the blockchain and its associated decentralized applications.

To install MetaMask, follow these steps:
