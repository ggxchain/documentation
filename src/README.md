### What is GGX Chain?

GGX chain is the interchain infrastructure protocol that utilizes Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for interoperable communication and advanced liquidity routing over a network of decentralized independent sub-chains.

GGX chain is built to connect arbitrary chains with each other turning sharded environment into the internet of blockchains.

### Why GGX Chain?

GGX chain is an interchain communication platform, allowing you to send messages and liquidity from one blockchain to another. GGX chain is also a smart contract platform, utilizing a hybrid virtual machine. GGX chain's hybrid virtual machine allows users to program in Solidity as well as any general purpose programming language that can be compiled into the WASM (e.g. Rust, Javascript).

We provide agnostic base layer communication, modern security techniques and zero-knowledge precompiles, providing the richest environment for dapps development, especially for dapps that require cross-chain communication.
