## Key Generation using Metamask Extension

GGX chain provides a support for EVM-based (H160) accounts. You can use the Metamask extension to create and manage EVM-based keys.

While operating as a validator requires a node-based ed25519 key, you can use EVM-based keys for other purposes, such as interacting with smart contracts. They also can be an easy way for end users to manage their accounts.

#### Converting sr25519/ed25519 to H160 (Ethereum address)

By using Keccak-256 function to generate hash from a public key and taking the rightmost 20 bytes of the hash, it's possible to get the H160 representation of the key.

### Setting up Metamask for GGX

3. Select "Add network manually" and fill in the following details:
   - Network Name: GGX Sydney Testnet
   - New RPC URL: https://testnet.node.sydney.ggxchain.io
   - Chain ID: 8886
