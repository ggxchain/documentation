## Key Generation using Polkadot.js Extension

The Polkadot.js extension is a browser extension that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Substrate-based chains, including GGX. It allows users to create key pairs with ease.

1. Install the Polkadot.js extension in your web browser (compatible with Chrome and Firefox).
2. Click on the extension icon, "+" button  and select "Create new account."

</div>
3. Safely store the generated recovery phrase (mnemonic phrase) and account details.

</div>
4. On the next step set a name for the account and a password.
<div align="center">
  <img src="../../polkadot-js-ext-password.png" alt="Polkadot.js account" style="max-width: 600px; margin: 20px 20px 40px 20px;" />
</div>
5. The newly created account will appear in the list.

**Note:** For security reasons, it is advisable to use this method only for accounts with limited access. For running a validator node or other high-security tasks, use the Subkey tool or node-based methods described below.

It's not possible to use this extension for creation or management of EVM-based keys.
