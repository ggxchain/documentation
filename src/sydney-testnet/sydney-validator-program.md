# Sydney validator programme

## Abstract

This document describes incentives and requirements for the Golden Gate Sydney validator programme.

## General Terms

The Golden Gate Sydney Validator programme, is a campaign launched by the Golden Gate team to attract validators for participation in the Golden Gate Sydney testnet. Sydney testnet is a Proof-of-Stake network based on the Golden Gate blockchain.

Golden Gate team holds privileged access to the network having the authority to upgrade and configure the network solely. We configured it this way to ensure failover in case of any emergency. We plan to revoke this access after the network gains enough maturity. Any usage of privileged access by the Golden Gate team will be transparent and evident to other network participants. Golden Gate team is not incentivized to use privileged access unless in an emergency.

Sydney testnet includes democracy routines. Any validator can propose a network upgrade or tokenomics parameter changes. The proposal will be the subject of voting by all Validators that have the minimum amount of tokens staked (1000 GGXT). The proposal is accepted/rejected by a simple majority rule.

## Validator Incentives

* **Rewards** - Validators in the Sydney network have the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of GGXT tokens. By staking and participating in the consensus mechanism, validators can receive regular rewards for their contribution to securing and maintaining the network. _\[tokenomics parameters here]_
* **Governance and Influence** - Validators play a vital role in the decentralized governance of the Sydney network. They have the power to vote on proposals and influence the direction of the network's development and upgrades. Participating as a validator allows individuals and organizations to have a say in the decision-making process and contribute to shaping the future of the network.
* **Community and Collaboration** - Participating as a validator provides an opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals and collaborate on projects and initiatives related to the Sydney network. It allows for knowledge sharing, networking, and building relationships with others in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.
* **Learning and Technical Experience** - Operating a validator node in the Sydney network requires technical knowledge and infrastructure setup. Participating as a validator can be a learning experience, allowing individuals and organizations to deepen their understanding of blockchain technology, consensus mechanisms, and network operations.
* **Supporting the Network:** Validators play a crucial role in the security and integrity of the Sydney network. By participating as a validator, individuals and organizations contribute to the network's overall health and resilience. Validators help ensure the network is secure, transactions are validated, and consensus is reached, thereby fostering trust and reliability in the Sydney ecosystem. Network quality directly affects GGXT token value.
