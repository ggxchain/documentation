<p>To stake GGXT tokens in the GGX Sydney testnet, please follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquire tokens. Please check out our <a href="../sydney-validator-program.html" title="Sydney Validator Program">Sydney Validator Program</a>.</li>
<li>Create two <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#substrate" class="glossary-term" title="An open-source modular framework for building custom blockchain networks and decentralized applications (dApps). It is developed by Parity Technologies and is designed to be flexible, scalable, and easy to use. It provides a set of pre-built modules that developers can use to create customized blockchain networks and dApps. These modules include functionality for consensus, networking, storage, governance, and more, allowing developers to quickly build and launch their own blockchain-based projects.">Substrate</a> accounts. You can do that using <a href="../../developer-documentation/wallets/polkadotjs.md">PolkadotJS</a>.</li>
<li>Distribute tokens between the <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#controller-account" class="glossary-term" title="A type of account that is used to control the staking and nomination activities of a stash account. A stash account is a primary account that holds a user&apos;s $GGX tokens and is used for staking and nominating, while the controller account is a separate account that is linked to the stash account to manage its staking and nomination activities.">controller account</a> and the <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#stash-account" class="glossary-term" title="The primary account that holds a user&apos;s $GGX tokens and is used for staking and nominating on the network. When a user wants to participate in staking and nominating activities, they must first transfer their $GGX tokens to their stash account.">stash account</a>. You will need at least 1000 GGXT tokens in the stash to stake.</li>
<li>After <a href="how-to-setup-a-validator-node.html">setting up a validator node</a> and receiving tokens you can stake using our <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#block-explorer" class="glossary-term" title="A tool that allows users to view and analyze the contents of a blockchain, including the transaction history, current status, and other important data. Block explorers are web-based applications that provide an intuitive user interface for navigating the blockchain, as well as a wide range of features for exploring and analyzing its data.">block explorer</a>.</li>
<li><p>Go to Network → <a href="../../GLOSSARY.html#staking" class="glossary-term" title="A lock-up mechanism which requires a certain amount of $GGX tokens to participate in network consensus and governance. Staking is a key mechanism in the Golden Gate ecosystem, as it helps secure the network and enables token holders to vote in the decision-making process.">Staking</a></p>
